						As a member of the IPC, you will have to represent a national or international news agency
						instead
						of a country. In preparation for this role, you must write an editorial instead of a position
						paper.
						The reporters will inform the conference about the happenings in the
						committees through the Press Conferences. It is engaging work, and more importantly it is fun.

						US State Abortion Laws:
						<br><br>
						Before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision (CASE : Roe Vs Wade) decriminalized abortion nationwide in 1973,
						abortion was already legal in several states.
						The decision, however, imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. Several
						groups have been at play and have vastly influenced the present scenario. Creation of financial
						and logistical barriers make it difficult or impossible for people to get abortions, despite
						what the law says.
						In 2019, several US states passed laws which effectively ban abortion, while others have taken
						steps to drastically restrict access to abortion.
						The reporters must send in their editorial pieces at least 24 hours prior to the commencement of

						the MUN. There is no word limit and reporters are free to use their creativity to express
						their/their agency’s view.

						<B>Agenda: Responsible Journalism in the world of Media Bias and Selective ‘Newsing’.</B>
						<BR><BR>
						<B>Remaining an Agency Without Bias</B><BR><BR>
						There are many different sources of news from the international press. Although reporters cover
						issues that are relevant to the nation and audience that views their media, it is not justified
						to use significant bias in their writing. What this means is that although a reporter is not
						obligated to cover certain stories, if they do cover a story, they should do so with total
						integrity and free from bias.<BR><BR>

						The committee shall discuss and aim to define a standard code to prevent any kind of bias
						in their reporting and preserve the integrity of the press.

							“Freedom of the press is the mortar that binds together the bricks of democracy — and it is
							also
							the open window embedded in those bricks. ”</b>
						<br><br>
						~ Shashi Tharoor

						<br><br>
						Dear Delegates,
						<br><br>
						Welcome to RMUN 2019!! We are extremely honored and excited to serve as the council for the
						International Press Corps.
						<br><br>

						The press has the privilege and responsibility of keeping the public informed and keeping those
						in power accountable!
						Over the course of the two days, you will assume the role of an international news agency and
						cover the events of the conference through that perspective.
						<br><br>

						Each news organization is unique in its tone, audience, slant, and editorial stance. As a
						journalist, you will be breaking stories, holding delegates accountable to their positions,
						communicating breakthroughs to the entire conference, along with exhibiting your flair in writing
						and eye for minute details. You will get to interview delegates, write news articles,
						release press briefs and opinion pieces.
						<br><br>

						The role of the Press Corps at RMUN 2019 and in the workings of international democracy cannot
						be understated.
						We hope that the first-hand experiences you will get as a journalist will further instill in you
						the importance of a free and independent press.
						<br><br>

						We are here to assist you while you prepare for the committee and beyond.
						Please reach out to us with any questions or concerns you might have - even if it’s just getting
						to know each other better!
						<br><br>

						We look forward to meeting you all and hope you have fun at this year’s conference!

						<br><br>
